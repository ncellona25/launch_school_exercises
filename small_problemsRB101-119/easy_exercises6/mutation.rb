# What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2

# Will return the words that begin with C or S upcased just as in array 1
# Both arrays point to the same objects so mutating one mutates the other
